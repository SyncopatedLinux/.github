# Syncopated Linux

## Overview

The target environment consists of Linux host running Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) applications.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to automate and standardize the configuration of various components involved in an open source audio production. Using Ansible, we aim to simplify the setup process, ensure consistency across different devices, and enhance productivity for audio professionals working in a Linux environment.

### Configuration Management:

Ansible allows us to define and manage the desired state of the audio production environment. This includes configuring software applications, system settings, and network parameters.

### Task Automation:

With Ansible's versatile automation capabilities, we can automate routine tasks involved in the audio production workflow. This includes launching applications, setting up project templates, managing audio file conversions, installing plugins and more.

[timemachine](http://plugin.org.uk/timemachine/): " I used to always keep a minidisc recorder in my studio running in a mode where when you pressed record it wrote the last 10 seconds of audio to the disk and then caught up to realtime and kept recording. The recorder died and haven't been able to replace it, so this is a simple jack app to do the same job. It has the advantage that it never clips and can be wired to any part of the jack graph. The idea is that I doodle away with whatever is kicking around in my studio and when I heard an interesting noise, I'd press record and capture it, without having to try and recreate it. :)""
